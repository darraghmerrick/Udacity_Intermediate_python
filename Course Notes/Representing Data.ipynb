Tuples are also used to \"freeze\" other collections to ensure hashability, so that otherwise unacceptably mutable objects (such as lists, sets, and dicts) can be used in sets and dictionaries. Tuples can be used to enforce immutability in fixed-size collections that shouldn't be changed.\n",

    "Get with Default\n",

    "## List Comprehensions\n",
    "A list comprehension is a concise way to create and populate a list in Python in a declarative, rather than imperative, fashion. Consider the following code snippet to produce a list of the first 100 perfect squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "squares = []\n",
    "for x in range(100):\n",
    "    squares.append(x ** 2)\n",
    "Really, what we'd like to describe is that we'd like a list of the squares of the first 100 elements – Python provides a syntactic tool to abbreviate this common pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "[x ** 2 for x in range(100)]\n",
    "The general structure of a list comprehension is:\n",
    "\n",
    "[f(xs) for xs in iter]\n",
    "The square brackets indicate that we're building a list. To write a list comprehension, we need both an iterable over which we'll iterate as well as an expression that transforms each element of the iterable to generate the new list elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, we might want to only keep elements that satisfy a predicate condition. For example, we could construct a list of only the even perfect squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "[x ** 2 for x in range(100) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "List comprehensions are remarkably useful for capturing a wide variety of data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lowercased versions of words in a sentence.\n",
    "[word.lower() for word in sentence]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Words in a sentence of more than 8 letters long.\n",
    "[word for word in sentence if len(word) > 8]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3-tuples of the first ten numbers and their squares and cubes.\n",
    "[(x, x ** 2, x ** 3) for x in range(10)]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indices for a triangular matrix.\n",
    "[(i,j) for i in range(5) for j in range(i)]\n",
    "Be careful – \"simple is better than complex\"! List comprehensions only provide a new syntax to perform the same types of operations we already could, so use them only when it simplifies your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do Comprehensions Matter?\n",
    "If list comprehensions only let us do what we already could, why do we care about them?\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual focus of imperative-style programming is on modifying individual elements – starting with an empty collection and building it up one-by-one. List comprehensions advance us by one level of abstraction – it's represents a transformation and filtering of another stream of elements. We don't have to specify how to build the collection – we simply describe the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, list comprehensions are incredibly convenient in a wide variety of situations, and are an important tool to have in your toolbelt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary and Set Comprehensions\n",
    "As with list comprehensions, Python provides concise syntax for creating dictionaries (or sets) on-the-fly based on a functional transformation of another iterable of elements. This technique is useful when you want to build a complete dictionary (or set) in one shot, rather than write iterative code to construct the collection one element at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "The syntax {key_func(vars): value_func(vars) for vars in iterable} creates a dictionary mapping keys to values. It's equivalent to the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "d = {}\n",
    "for vars in iterable:\n",
    "    d[key_func(vars)] = value_func(vars)\n",
    "return d\n",
    "For example, to swap the keys and values in a dictionary,* we can use the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "return {v: k for k, v in d.items()}\n",
    "As before, there can be optional predicates tacked onto the end: {key_func(vars): val_func(vars) for vars in iterable if predicate_func(vars)}.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the expression {student: grades for student, grades in gradebook.items() if sum(grades) / len(grades) > 90 builds a dictionary of student grades for students whose average grade is at least 90.**\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if multiple keys map to the same value? Try it out in the interactive interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would happen if a student exists, but has no grades, in the gradebook? How could you modify the dictionary expression to avoid this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "Set Comprehensions\n",
    "Set comprehensions work in a similar way – here, the expression on the left side is not a key:value mapping, but any element. The general pattern of a set comprehension is {func(vars) for vars in iterable} or, with a predicate, {func(vars) for vars in iterable if predicate(vars)}\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that we have a list of words from Shakespeare's Hamlet, and a predicate function is_palindrome that returns whether a string is a palindrome.
