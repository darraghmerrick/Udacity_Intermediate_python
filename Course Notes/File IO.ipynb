    "## File Systems and Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's built-in pathlib module provides object-oriented filesystem paths\n",
    "## pathlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's built-in pathlib module provides object-oriented filesystem paths, and it's a useful introduction to thinking about the layout of files on a filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are loads of useful things you can do with Paths (the documentation page is well-worth reading) but you'll be able to get by with the following pieces of functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "here = Path('.')  # Get an instance of a Path subclass describing the interpreter's current location (which is usually, but not necessarily, the directory containing your Python files).\n",
    "here = here.resolve()  # Resolve symbolic links and `..` segments into an absolute `Path`.\n",
    "parent = here.parent  # Navigate up the chain of parents. A purely lexical operation, so it's important to call `.resolve()` or a similar method first.\n",
    "child = here / 'subfolder' / 'subfile.txt'  # Navigate to a subfolder or subfile. Hooray for magic methods (`__div__`) and polymorphism!\n",
    "To reiterate, the important concept is that files are organized on a filesystem through nested directories (\"folders\"), with a specific file path from the root folder or a drive. The important detail is that Python's pathlib module provides good tools for working with files and file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plain Text Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The general pattern for reading and writing plain text from files is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract data from a file into Python\n",
    "Open a file-like object f\n",
    "Call f.read() or a similar method\n",
    "Do something with the data, now within Python\n",
    "Write data from Python to a file.\n",
    "Open a file-like object f\n",
    "Call f.write(line) or a similar method\n",
    "Plain Text File I/O diagram\n",
    "Plain Text File I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening a File\n",
    "The open function in Python can open a file-like object from a path-like object, for reading, writing, or perhaps both (there are a few more flags as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(filepath, mode) as f:\n",
    "    # Use the file-like object `f`\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "The mode can be 'r' for reading, or 'w' for writing, and there are a few other options too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new syntax of the with statement ensures that the opened file-like object will be closed when we exit the block - it's good hygiene when working with resources like files. It's roughly equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    f = open(filepath, mode)\n",
    "    # Use the file-like object `f`\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    f.close()\n",
    "In this way, even if an error occurs in the body, Python will make sure to immediately close the file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## QUIZ QUESTION\n",
