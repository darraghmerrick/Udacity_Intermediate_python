    "Programming Paradigms\n",
    "Much like our exploration of functional programming, our journey through object-oriented programming consists of just one of the many programming paradigms supported by Python. To recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the procedural way of thinking, programs are glorified sequences of steps.\n",
    "In the declarative way of thinking, programs are formal specifications of the desired output.\n",
    "In the object-oriented way of thinking, programs are objects and there are many ways that they interact\n",
    "In the functional way of thinking, programs are actions that are nested and composed.\n",
    "It's important to mention that the lines between each style of problem-solving are blurry â€“ there is certainly sizeable overlap. However, for this lesson we'll center on the following idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are about nouns (objects), categories of nouns, and the ways they interact with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "To revisit the central theme of interfaces, implementations, and abstractions, we often think about an object as bundling complex implementation detail (data and methods) and providing a simplified interface. For example, if we imagine an instance of a Car, it's nice to know that we can drive() a car without needed to know precisely the mechanics of what goes into transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blueprints and Houses\n",
    "An essential distinction when framing programs through the lens of object-oriented program is that of a class object and an instance object. In analogy, it's useful to think of a class object as a blueprint, and an instance object as a particular house. A blueprint (class object) can be instantiated to create an actual house (an instance object of that class). Each have their own attributes - a blueprint might specify a background color for the blueprint itself, or a shape that applies to all houses, whereas a single house might have attributes such as a number of bathrooms, a price, or the total weight of the house in kilograms, or actions such as \"close all of the windows\" or \"install a new microwave.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "More succinctly, a class object provides a template from which new instance objects can be constructed, and represents a category (sometimes called a type) of things. An instance object (of a particular class object) is a concrete instantiation of that class object. Each can have properties, whether data or actions, attached to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we'll sometimes call a \"class object\" a \"class\" or an \"instance object\" an \"instance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to our Python nomenclature, recall that everything in Python is an object (which has an identity), a name is a reference to an object, and a namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Then, an attribute is any name after a dot (.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, it's important to learn to use object-based design in order to: (1) create custom classes that represent complex bundles of data and actions; (2) connect your classes to Python itself; and (3) better understand Python's behavior under-the-hood, because everything is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap: Python differentiates between the idea of a class object and an instance object. Class objects can be instantiated to create an instance object. Each of class objects and instance objects support attribute resolution, in which Python searches for a matching attribute starting from the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Terms\n",
    "Term\tDefinition\n",
    "Attribute\tA name following a dot (such as obj.name), which represents information that is attached to an object.\n",
    "Attribute Resolution\tThe process by which Python determines the value associated with an attribute.\n",
    "Class Object\tAn object representing a type or category of objects.\n",

    "To resolve an attribute on a class object, Python searches for the attribute name in the class object's __dict__ (effectively, the class object's \"local namespace\" mapping attribute names to values). If we found it, great! If not, Python proceeds recursively up through a linearization of the class object's superclasses (the precise details of which we won't explain here), each time searching for a matching attribute name. If the attribute name is found in none of the superclasses, Python raises an AttributeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is what allows us to utilize several nice features of Python. Every class object is a subclass of the special class object named object, which itself defines some attributes like __init__ and __str__. This way, even if our class object doesn't have an attribute named __init__ explicitly defined, Python can still find an __init__ - the one from the object class object. Same with __str__, which gives human-readable string representations of objects. The __str__ method on a generic object isn't very interesting - it prints out <{the_object_name} at 0x{some_address}>\", but it nevertheless exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that, even if MyClass.__init__ ends up producing the same object as object.__init__, any assignments to MyClass.__init__ will create a \"local\" attribute named __init__ on the MyClass object, as you'd hope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attribute Resolution on Instances\n",
    "For instances, the story is a bit more complex. To resolve instance.attribute, first, as before, Python checks for whether 'attribute' is in instance.__dict__. If so, great! We're done. If not, Python tries to resolve the attribute name on the class object of the instance object, using the recursive process described above. If the attribute isn't found anywhere, Python raises an AttributeError. Otherwise, we're almost done. If the value we got back from resolving the attribute on the class object is not a function, that's the value we return directly. We did it! If it _is_ a function, then the value that is returned is a method that bundles the function attribute along with the instance object with which we began this search.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, it's important to note that even if an attribute resolves somewhere way up the chain (such as home.layout being finally found at House.layout, any assignment to home.layout will assign to home itself (i.e. to home.__dict__, in effect shadowing the class-level attribute."

    "## Class Naming Conventions\n",

    "It's nice to adapt to common conventions for writing Python classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use self as the first parameter of method definitions, such as def bake(self, temperature, minutes):, so that you get in the habit of using a consistent name to refer to the instance object that's supplied as the first argument.\n",
    "For class methods, it's customary to use a name like cls. For static methods, anything goes.\n",
    "Use verbs for methods and nouns for data attributes. Otherwise, it can be hard to tell which attributes are callable and which are not.\n",

    "Nothing Is Private!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to Python, it's nearly impossible to hide.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want an attribute to seem \"secret,\" you can prefix it with an underscore to indicate to other programmers that it's not part of the public interface. Often, in this case it's nice to include a managed getter (e.g. an @property) or even setter to handle access or assignment to the attribute. In extreme cases, you can use two underscores to begin (but not end) an attribute name to invoke Python's name mangling, which makes it harder (but not impossible) to access the attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, these are conventions. In Python, almost nothing is truly private. With great power comes great responsibility.\n",

If Python needs to evaluate print(obj), it will call the magic method obj.__str__. If Python needs to evaluate obj + other, it will first attempt to call obj.__add__(other). There are magic methods for nearly all built-in Python behaviors, so by implementing the correct ones, we can make our class act like a Sized container, have a human-readable representation, or even act a bit like a numeric type, able to be added to other objects.\n",

    "If any exceptions are raised while evaluating the code inside a try block, the sequence of except blocks is scanned linearly for a matching superclass of the error. Then, that except block is executed, so that we (the programmers) can define custom code to handle exceptions. If no matching except block is found, the error is propagated upwards. If no errors occur in the try block, the else block is executed if it exists. Finally, almost no matter what, the finally block is executed, and can be used to define unconditional cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "If exceptions occur in the except, else, or finally blocks, Python complains loudly about errors while it was trying to handle other errors.\n",

    "## Bare except blocks\n",

    "A bare except block captures all exceptions, including subclasses of BaseException like KeyboardInterrupt or SystemExit! This means that you almost never want except: and instead want to capture a specific class of errors, like except ValueError:\n",

If there is code that you don't want to protect, but that logically should run only if prior code didn't error, it belongs in the else block.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this exercise, you'll refactor working code to make use of the principles of errors and exceptional control flow. This program is ostensibly a password-checker - it tries to validate a password and then \"creates an account,\" which for our purposes just returns a tuple containing both the username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "While totally legitimate, this program as written uses a boolean return value (from validate_password) to signal validity. This program can be modified so that validate_password raises an InvalidPasswordError if the password is invalid. Perhaps you can add a helpful message to the user in these errors, or combine the password validation logic into create_account, so that it either produces a valid \"account\" or raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, you'll need to define a new Exception subclass, modify the validate_password function to use that error to signal failure, and update the main method to consume the error that might be produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise was to confront the use of errors in Python by adapting functional code to explicitly use Exceptions rather than booleans to signal failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, and most important step, is that we create an InvalidPasswordError that is a subclass of ValueError, so that it's part of the Exception hierarchy. With that defined, the validate_password function can raise an InvalidPasswordError with a helpful message if the supplied password is invalid. Finally, the main function will use a try/except/else/finally block to (1) attempt to validate a password, (2) respond to any InvalidPasswordError raised in the try block, (3) create an account if there was no InvalidPasswordError, and finally print a generic cleanup message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but the lesson that exceptional control flow is a powerful way to handle errors in Python remains true."
