    "Programming Paradigms\n",
    "Much like our exploration of functional programming, our journey through object-oriented programming consists of just one of the many programming paradigms supported by Python. To recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the procedural way of thinking, programs are glorified sequences of steps.\n",
    "In the declarative way of thinking, programs are formal specifications of the desired output.\n",
    "In the object-oriented way of thinking, programs are objects and there are many ways that they interact\n",
    "In the functional way of thinking, programs are actions that are nested and composed.\n",
    "It's important to mention that the lines between each style of problem-solving are blurry â€“ there is certainly sizeable overlap. However, for this lesson we'll center on the following idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are about nouns (objects), categories of nouns, and the ways they interact with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "To revisit the central theme of interfaces, implementations, and abstractions, we often think about an object as bundling complex implementation detail (data and methods) and providing a simplified interface. For example, if we imagine an instance of a Car, it's nice to know that we can drive() a car without needed to know precisely the mechanics of what goes into transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blueprints and Houses\n",
    "An essential distinction when framing programs through the lens of object-oriented program is that of a class object and an instance object. In analogy, it's useful to think of a class object as a blueprint, and an instance object as a particular house. A blueprint (class object) can be instantiated to create an actual house (an instance object of that class). Each have their own attributes - a blueprint might specify a background color for the blueprint itself, or a shape that applies to all houses, whereas a single house might have attributes such as a number of bathrooms, a price, or the total weight of the house in kilograms, or actions such as \"close all of the windows\" or \"install a new microwave.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "More succinctly, a class object provides a template from which new instance objects can be constructed, and represents a category (sometimes called a type) of things. An instance object (of a particular class object) is a concrete instantiation of that class object. Each can have properties, whether data or actions, attached to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we'll sometimes call a \"class object\" a \"class\" or an \"instance object\" an \"instance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to our Python nomenclature, recall that everything in Python is an object (which has an identity), a name is a reference to an object, and a namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Then, an attribute is any name after a dot (.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, it's important to learn to use object-based design in order to: (1) create custom classes that represent complex bundles of data and actions; (2) connect your classes to Python itself; and (3) better understand Python's behavior under-the-hood, because everything is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap: Python differentiates between the idea of a class object and an instance object. Class objects can be instantiated to create an instance object. Each of class objects and instance objects support attribute resolution, in which Python searches for a matching attribute starting from the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Terms\n",
    "Term\tDefinition\n",
    "Attribute\tA name following a dot (such as obj.name), which represents information that is attached to an object.\n",
    "Attribute Resolution\tThe process by which Python determines the value associated with an attribute.\n",
    "Class Object\tAn object representing a type or category of objects.\n",

    "To resolve an attribute on a class object, Python searches for the attribute name in the class object's __dict__ (effectively, the class object's \"local namespace\" mapping attribute names to values). If we found it, great! If not, Python proceeds recursively up through a linearization of the class object's superclasses (the precise details of which we won't explain here), each time searching for a matching attribute name. If the attribute name is found in none of the superclasses, Python raises an AttributeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is what allows us to utilize several nice features of Python. Every class object is a subclass of the special class object named object, which itself defines some attributes like __init__ and __str__. This way, even if our class object doesn't have an attribute named __init__ explicitly defined, Python can still find an __init__ - the one from the object class object. Same with __str__, which gives human-readable string representations of objects. The __str__ method on a generic object isn't very interesting - it prints out <{the_object_name} at 0x{some_address}>\", but it nevertheless exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that, even if MyClass.__init__ ends up producing the same object as object.__init__, any assignments to MyClass.__init__ will create a \"local\" attribute named __init__ on the MyClass object, as you'd hope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attribute Resolution on Instances\n",
    "For instances, the story is a bit more complex. To resolve instance.attribute, first, as before, Python checks for whether 'attribute' is in instance.__dict__. If so, great! We're done. If not, Python tries to resolve the attribute name on the class object of the instance object, using the recursive process described above. If the attribute isn't found anywhere, Python raises an AttributeError. Otherwise, we're almost done. If the value we got back from resolving the attribute on the class object is not a function, that's the value we return directly. We did it! If it _is_ a function, then the value that is returned is a method that bundles the function attribute along with the instance object with which we began this search.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, it's important to note that even if an attribute resolves somewhere way up the chain (such as home.layout being finally found at House.layout, any assignment to home.layout will assign to home itself (i.e. to home.__dict__, in effect shadowing the class-level attribute."
