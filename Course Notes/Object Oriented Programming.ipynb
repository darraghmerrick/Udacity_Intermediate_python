    "Programming Paradigms\n",
    "Much like our exploration of functional programming, our journey through object-oriented programming consists of just one of the many programming paradigms supported by Python. To recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the procedural way of thinking, programs are glorified sequences of steps.\n",
    "In the declarative way of thinking, programs are formal specifications of the desired output.\n",
    "In the object-oriented way of thinking, programs are objects and there are many ways that they interact\n",
    "In the functional way of thinking, programs are actions that are nested and composed.\n",
    "It's important to mention that the lines between each style of problem-solving are blurry â€“ there is certainly sizeable overlap. However, for this lesson we'll center on the following idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are about nouns (objects), categories of nouns, and the ways they interact with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "To revisit the central theme of interfaces, implementations, and abstractions, we often think about an object as bundling complex implementation detail (data and methods) and providing a simplified interface. For example, if we imagine an instance of a Car, it's nice to know that we can drive() a car without needed to know precisely the mechanics of what goes into transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blueprints and Houses\n",
    "An essential distinction when framing programs through the lens of object-oriented program is that of a class object and an instance object. In analogy, it's useful to think of a class object as a blueprint, and an instance object as a particular house. A blueprint (class object) can be instantiated to create an actual house (an instance object of that class). Each have their own attributes - a blueprint might specify a background color for the blueprint itself, or a shape that applies to all houses, whereas a single house might have attributes such as a number of bathrooms, a price, or the total weight of the house in kilograms, or actions such as \"close all of the windows\" or \"install a new microwave.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "More succinctly, a class object provides a template from which new instance objects can be constructed, and represents a category (sometimes called a type) of things. An instance object (of a particular class object) is a concrete instantiation of that class object. Each can have properties, whether data or actions, attached to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we'll sometimes call a \"class object\" a \"class\" or an \"instance object\" an \"instance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to our Python nomenclature, recall that everything in Python is an object (which has an identity), a name is a reference to an object, and a namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Then, an attribute is any name after a dot (.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, it's important to learn to use object-based design in order to: (1) create custom classes that represent complex bundles of data and actions; (2) connect your classes to Python itself; and (3) better understand Python's behavior under-the-hood, because everything is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap: Python differentiates between the idea of a class object and an instance object. Class objects can be instantiated to create an instance object. Each of class objects and instance objects support attribute resolution, in which Python searches for a matching attribute starting from the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Terms\n",
    "Term\tDefinition\n",
    "Attribute\tA name following a dot (such as obj.name), which represents information that is attached to an object.\n",
    "Attribute Resolution\tThe process by which Python determines the value associated with an attribute.\n",
    "Class Object\tAn object representing a type or category of objects.\n",
    "Instance Object\tAn object representing a concrete instantiation of a class of objects.\n",
    "Instantiation\tThe process by which Python creates an instance object from a class object.\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming\tA programming paradigm focusing on objects bundling data and actions as fundamental tools for solving problems.\n"

    "print(MyFirstClass.num)  # 12345\n",
    "print(MyFirstClass.greet)  # <function MyFirstClass.greet(self)>\n",
