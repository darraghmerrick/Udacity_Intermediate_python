    "### Python Standard Library\n",
    "The core Python language is defined by the [Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index). These features can be used in any scripts with no need to import other modules. They include basic functionality like simple datatypes for primitives (such as strings and integers) as well as basic sequences (like lists and tuples).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index) extends the functionality of the python language with many features that are commonly needed by programmers. These modules are \"built into\" Python, but they must be imported to the program when they're used. The array module is one of many examples of a built-in standard library module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need to Import Anyway?\n",
    "You may be wondering why everything isn't included in the language reference. Why do we need to import specific modules rather than having everything simply available all the time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think of an analogy. As we're practicing programming, there are fundamental concepts that we have memorized—for example, we remember how to call the print function, or assign a value to a variable. There are also more complex programming patterns that we might not use every day, but need to use once in a while—things like [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are costs and benefits to both of these strategies. Looking things up as we need them means that we don't need to spend as much time memorizing things we don't do very often. But on the other hand, some tools are so basic and frequently used that we want them to be immediately available to us. We might do a web search or refer to the documentation to refresh our memory on something, but this search takes time. It would be inefficient for us to look up every detail of programming, and it would be nearly impossible for us to memorize everything we don't always need.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is analogous to the situation with the Language Reference and the Standard Library. The Python developers made a decision about which fundamental features are most used and included these in the Language Reference so they're always available and efficient, while pushing other features out to the Standard Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you may find that in your particular work you use certain features (that aren't included in the Language Reference) very often. The nice thing is that Python's import mechanics allow us to define our own modules and features and bind them dynamically at runtime. We'll get into this more later in the course.\n",
    "\n",

    "For more discussion on importing, you may want to read the Stack Overflow post, [Why Does Python Not Import Every Module at Startup Automatically?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21007255/why-does-python-not-import-every-module-at-startup-automatically)\n"

    "## Code Style\n",
    "### Why do we need to standardize styles?\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) are a set of guidelines that are driven by the community. They help Python developers understand key Python language decisions and implement uniform code. PEP-8 and PEP-20 are two of the more common proposals you'll encounter. They focus on style and implementation guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The PEP 8 guidelines aren't just arbitrary rules—there are underlying reasons for each of the guidelines. You can often find interesting discussions of these underlying reasons on Stack Overflow, such as in [this post on why PEP 8 says you should indent with spaces rather than tabs.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/120926/why-does-python-pep-8-strongly-recommend-spaces-over-tabs-for-indentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing PEP 8 with linting\n",
    "PEP 8 has a lot of rules and chances are that you will forget many of them while you're developing. Thankfully, there are tools you can use to help you check your code for standardization and quality. These are called linters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) is a tool that checks the quality of your source code. Linters can check for a variety of errors, ranging from programmatic mistakes to stylistic issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll often hear programmers talk about linting their code, which simply means that they are running a program (a linter) that scans the source code to help them detect any issues. You may wonder if this term has the same origin as the lint you find in a clothes dryer, and the answer is yes—the idea is that a linter helps you clean up all those undesirable bits of stuff that have been accumulating in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different linters available, even just for Python alone. We'll try out one of them—called pycodestyle on the next page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Resources\n",

    "### Multi-Line Strings\n",
    "Sometimes we end up wanting to use very long strings, and this can cause some problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "story =  \"Once upon a time there was a very long string that was over 100 characters long and could not all fit on the screen at once.\"\n",
    "print(story)\n",
    "If you run pycodestyle on this, you'll get the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "some_script.py:1:80: E501 line too long (134 > 79 characters)\n",
    "This line too long message is telling us that the line should be 79 characters or less in length, but that it is actually 134 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is that a problem?\n",
    "In some cases, long lines work just fine. If you have a very large monitor and are looking at your code fullscreen, even a line that is 100 or 200 characters long may fit on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "But more often, long lines cause problems. You may be working on a small screen, or want to have your code editor take up only half the screen (so that, say, you can have your terminal running in the other half).\n",
    "\n",
    "For such reasons, the Python style guide recommends keeping all lines of code to a maximum of 79 characters in length—or even 72 characters, in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious, you can read more in the style guide section on maximum line length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example string above is well over the recommended 72-79 characters. So to make the code more readable, we need a way of splitting it to multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's play around and see what we can do."

    "### Refresher - Objects in Python\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way for us to structure our code so that data and behaviors are related to one another in a logical (and usually more intuitive) way—allowing us to interact with our code as if it were composed of distinct objects. Many Python libraries demonstrate object-oriented design, and for good reason: As our programs grow, making use of OOP design patterns can help ensure that our code remains modular, well-organized, and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes in OOP\n",
    "Classes group together data (instance variables) and actions that can be performed on that data (instance methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is that a class defines how these instance variables and methods are combined to represent the concept of a given type of objects. In the video, we used the example of a cat—but we can have classes to represent all sorts of different objects (e.g. documents, images, cars, random-number generators, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "As our systems become larger, our classes can be combined and extended to produce more complex actions. However, it is important to consider the main roles and responsibilities of a class—aiming to keep each class small and easily maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cat Class Example\n",
    "In this class, we do assume that you already know the basic syntax for defining a class. If you need a refresher, you may want to skim through the [Python classes documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).\n",

Often we'll use a visual design language known as Unified Modeling Language (UML) to achieve this goal. UML was developed in the 1990s to help developers express software concepts visually.\n",

    "## Typing in Python\n",
    "### What are Types?\n",
    "\n",
    "All values have a type—for example, 100 is an integer value and \"Hello world!\" is a string value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the type of a variable is defined dynamically. In the below example, the type of the x variable changes dynamically from an integer to a float simply as a result of us assigning it different values:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = 1\n",
    ">>> type(x)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    ">>> x = 1.1\n",
    ">>> type(x)\n",
    "<class 'float'>\n",
    "This can get us into trouble if we, for instance, pass a value to a function that is the wrong type:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> def function(x, y):\n",
    "...     return x + y\n",
    "... \n",
    ">>> function('x', 'b')\n",
    "'xb'\n",
    ">>> function('x', 1)\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in function\n",
    "TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "Weakly vs Strongly Typed Languages\n",
    "Python, along with JavaScript and PHP, are all weakly typed languages, meaning that they infer the data type dynamically. In general, the benefits of weakly typed languages are that they are more flexible and require less code. But there's also a higher possibility of errors, especially as your codebase grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, languages like C, C++, and Java are strongly typed languages—meaning that they require the type to be specified when a variable is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Python has a feature called type annotations that will allow us to get many of the benefits of a strongly typed language—we'll learn more about this a bit later on.\n",

    "No matter how experienced we are as developers, we will write bugs into our software. \n",

    "By using this design pattern, we'll have a better understanding of where, how, and why our software fails.\n",
